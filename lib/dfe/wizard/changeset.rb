    # A plain object over the wizard's state store. Its fields live under
    # one reserved top-level key, `_dfe_wizard`, written through
    # `state_store.write` like any answer. The answers stay where they are.
    # The fields are the change journey state and, for an edit of a saved
    # record, the seed, the record's `updated_at`, the record identity and
    # the caller URL.

    # Building a changeset reads and writes nothing, so a wizard that does
    # not use change journeys is unaffected.
