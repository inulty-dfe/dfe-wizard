      # Navigation through wizard steps

      # Manages step traversal, paths, and direction based on:
      # - Step processor (graph structure & branching)
      # - Current wizard state (user data)

      # Provides two types of APIs:
      # 1. Step navigation: next_step, previous_step, *_step_path
      # 2. Flow paths: flow_path, in_flow? (graph-based)

        # after they are saved.
